# Comment-Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis on an amazon food dataset.

In this repository there are different models that analyze the opinion left by travelers on twitter. The data has been taken from a [competition in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spanish-arilines-tweets-sentiment-analysis/overview) carried out by a Spanish areoline. The data has been processed and various techniques have been tried for its processing.

## Text mining

- Tokenizer: [punkt](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/tokenize/punkt.html)
- [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/): is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.

## Machine Learning

- Bag of words([TF-idf and Boolean model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model))
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost


## Deep Learning

- Word Embedding([Word2Vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec))
- [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory): Long short-term memory.
